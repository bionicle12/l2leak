Reverse engineered code of L2OFF server Chronicles-1

This code is published for STUDY PURPOSE ONLY. If you want use this code, you should contact NCSoft.

**NOTE**: branch "legacy" contains only ORIGINALY decompiled code, with origin bugs, MSVC2008 required to build it.
**NOTE**: branch "develop" is an Extender branch, based on "legacy", with fixes for C1/C4/C6 clients with disabled game server packet encryption
**NOTE**: All fixes and improvements are going to "develop" branch. **MSVC2013** or higher is required to build it.

### Consists of 3 parts:
* generated/ - directory, which contains IDA (6.8) / Hex-Rays generated decompiled code, which is used as a reference to further creating of compilable code
* reversed/ - directory, which contains manualy fixed generated code - structure definitions, renamings, etc.
* src/ - directory, which contains manualy fixed compilable code

### How to Build
* install newest cmake
* go to the project's root directory
* run commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
```

or to build with MSVC 2008 x32(Debug):
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" ../
```

or to build MSVC 2008 x64(Debug):

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64"  ../
```

or Release:

```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ../
```

or to build with MSVC 2013 (devel branch):
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" ../
```

* after that, you will have MSVC project inside build/ directory,

Then
```
cmake --build .
cmake --build . --target install
```
* after that, you will have ready-to-use L2AuthD inside build/install

#L2AuthD
* Reverse engineered code of L2AuthD.exe (China server, 2004.06.04, MD5 8e67c0b42a06ecaf7fc0ac579b43506e), build version: 40504
* All modules were originally decompiled, including Blowfish algorithm, MD5, original prints (including Korean), password encryptions (for DB access and user ones), packet handling, call-stack report during crash, mail server, INI-file reading, etc
* The ONLY foreign code is DES algorithm. I wasn't able to decompile it at 100%, so some other open-source implementation is used
* Orignal Blowfish key is used: 5B 3B 27 2E 5D 39 34 2D 33 31 3D 3D 2D 25 26 40 21 5E 2B 5D 00. Note, that there are few packs with changed BF keys:
```
5F 3B 35 2E 5D 39 34 2D 33 31 3D 3D 2D 25 78 54 21 5E 5B 24
6E 63 73 6F 66 74 6C 69 6E 65 61 67 65 32 2E 63 6F 6D 20 20
5B 3B 27 2E 5D 39 34 2D 33 31 3D 3D 2D 25 26 40 21 5E 2B 5D
```

#L2LogD
* Reverse engineered code of L2LogD.exe (China server, 2004.06.04, MD5 b59aec997d9c2386d02809e784e16e4b)

#CacheD
* Reverse engineered code of CacheD.exe (China server, 2004.06.04, MD5 03c47919478b01b96653bf9e5beb7141)
